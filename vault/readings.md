# Key readings
Here I outline some of the key readings I engage in the development of my notes. For now I'll order this by general themes.

# The World
My own background and interest is in hermeneutic phenomenology which merges two philosophical traditions: phenomenology and hermeneutics. Phenomenology is a philosophical movement interested in investigating the relation between human beings and their world. We can appreciate the significance of this by considering the relation between theory and reality, which we can succinctly state as that relation between subject and object.

Hermeneutic phenomenology investigates the human-world relation in terms of how the world can show itself to human beings and become meaningful. The main concern here is with interpretation and meaning, or in other words the general idea of world disclosure. Hermeneutics is a traditional philosophical discipline related to the discovery of meaning.
